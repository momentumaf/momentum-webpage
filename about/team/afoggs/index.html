        <section class="bio">
          <p>Around winter of 2016, I joined a business that one of my associates had started. I believed in his vision and I saw that he had a need that I personally could fulfill: IT work. Initially, I focused solely on the IT infrastructure of the company, but as time went on, I began to take on even more responsibility​. I found agreed less with how to do things and more so only with the end result. Eventually, it got to a point where myself and two other individuals decided that it'd be best if we diverged from the company and pursued our goals in a different manner. On January 17th, 2017, Amatziah Snipes, Ramone Kittrell and myself, Antoine Foggs, officially separated from our old business and formed Momentum AF.</p>

          <p>As the CIO, my primary work involves a lot of data analytics, website management and overall ensuring that our IT infrastructure is running at the most optimal level, continuously improving faults wherever they are while other times engineering innovative solutions for any unexpected problems the company may encounter.</p>

          <p>Outside of that, I enjoy indulging in my love of reading and writing. On my blog, you can find a wide array of my, however, my true passion is creating inspirational and motivational pieces that either spark in someone the desire to be productive, or simply bring a smile to the face of someone whose day needed a bit of sunshine.</p>

          <p>I taught myself how to play  a few instruments [piano, guitar, and I'm currently learning violin] and i also learned trombone on high school. When I'm not reading or touching an instrument of some sort, I'm likely studying Japanese or Spanish.</p>

          <p>Fun facts: I was born on Mother's day and my favorite food is Macaroni and Cheese</p>
