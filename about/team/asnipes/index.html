        <section class="bio">
          <p>I have always dreamed of being my own boss. Dedicating my time and efforts to many companies, I realized that I was working to survive. I wasn't actually living, loving, or laughing; I wasn't enjoying my life. I chose to become a part of something that would make an impact on society in the years to come. While helping an associate of mine, I was introduced to a group of talented individuals who had a similar realization. And just like that, Momentum AF was formed to make my dream a reality.</p>

          <p>As the COO, I govern client relations, project management, event planning, volunteer work, and internal operations. Each of these play an integral part of our business. Here in operations, we specialize in ensuring 100% client satisfaction.</p>

          <p>In my free time, you can be sure to find me writing in a journal, behind a mic at an open mic, or in the kitchen working up a new recipe! My favorite food varies. (I'm a cook!) If I had to pick only one. It would have to be baked mac and cheese! Over the years, my hobbies and shifted and changed, but these have remained the same.</p>

          <p>My passion in life has always been education. I never wanted to become a teacher, but instead I desired to lead people through knowledge. I chose to become an educator outside of the classroom to continue my purpose as I lay way to my legacy.</p>
