        <section class="bio">
          <p>I met Antoine and Amatziah through mutual friends. After getting to know them, I discovered they both had aspirations to start their own businesses and both wanted to use their skills to do so. I always wanted to start a company from the ground up, and once I saw their work ethic and commitment level I knew we would be a good fit. We decided to start working on small consulting projects just to bring in some income for ourselves. Once we saw how many businesses we could help we wanted to grow our “side hustle” into a booming business and haven't looked back since.</p>

          <p>I manage all of our capital and make sure our books are in order. Most of my time is spent conducting market research for our clients and seeking new projects that our team can work. I have a few internal responsibilities, but my largest is setting expectations for our team and making sure we exceed our goals every single time we take on a project.</p>

          <p>I want to be the most knowledgeable businessperson in the world before I die.</p>

          <h3>What are my hobbies?</h3>
            <li>I read about different cultures and what's going on around the world.</li>
            <li>I like to eat and will try any dish at least twice.</li>
            <li>I play videogames on weekends and try to go to a zoo, greenhouse or aquarium whenever I have the time.</li>

          <p>My favorite food is anything thats is well seasoned and spicy. I love Ethiopian, Senegalese and Creole dishes. I eat a lot of fresh fruit, so any fruit based dessert will get a stamp of approval from me.</p>
